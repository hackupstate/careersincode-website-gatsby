# Careers in Code

A wesbite for Hack Upstate's Careers in Code

Careers in Code is Hack Upstate‚Äôs new initiative to help advance Central New York‚Äôs tech community by offering computer programming education to help fight poverty. It is a 24-week program aimed at women and minorities from distressed areas of central New York‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpoverty in these neighborhoods means residents don‚Äôt have equal opportunities to access education and employment opportunities, and our bootcamp was created to help close this gap and increase our region‚Äôs economic potential.

## Running the repo
1. `npm install` 
2. `npm run start`

## Contributing

1. Clone down the code: `git clone https://github.com/hackupstate/careersincode-dynamic.git`
2. When you are creating your remote origin, remember that you should NOT be using the master branch. Instead, create a branch. This repo utilizes pull requests for content management.
3. Once cloned and initialized properly, try pushing a commit to your branch. In some cases, you may need to push to the HEAD, which would change your push message (ie. git push origin HEAD:dev).

## Use of PR's in this Repo

For the purposes of version tracking and team management, we will be using Pull Requests to manage all pushes to master. This is a really great tool for team use on Git as it minimizes the possibility of messing up the main website and helps keep your version separate (allowing you to experiment with no worries, etc.). This also allows the team manager to review code independently before it goes live (Netlify‚Äôs prod feature is great for this!).

Once you have developed a particular feature and are ready for review, follow these steps:

1. Commit and push your code to your own branch. Remember that since you are working on a team, people can‚Äôt read your mind. Be specific enough in your commit messages to let us know what you worked on.
2. Once you have committed your code, go to the Github website, and navigate to your branch. Next to the branch selector above the code section, click ‚ÄúNew Pull Request.‚Äù Github should automatically have your branch pulling into master.
3. In this dialogue, you can edit your commit message and request reviewers on the right hand side, if necessary (you should be doing this most of the time for Will).
4. Send the request and notify your reviewer on Slack (for some reason we don‚Äôt always get an email).
5. If your code is good, (yay!), then the reviewer will merge it with master. If any changes are necessary, you do not need to submit another PR. Simply push the new version of your code to your own branch. Github will automatically add your changes to the existing PR and update the review guide for your reviewer. Here, it‚Äôs especially important to keep your commit messages specific as things get added under that assumption.

## üéì Learning Gatsby
